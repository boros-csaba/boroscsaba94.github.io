<h1>Data policy</h1>
Your privacy is very important to us, and we take it seriously. Please read our Data Consent information below and let us know if you have any questions or other feedback regarding it.<br />
<br/>
<b>Advertising</b><br/>
The app uses advertising to provide the content free of charge. When you use the app your device automatically sends certain information to our advertising partner, Admob. This information includes, for example, the name of the app, the device type, and the advertising ID. The information gathered is solely used to provide our advertising partners with the bare minimum of information they need to provide their services and combat click fraud.<br/>You will be asked for consent before seeing any advertisements. The consent will be presented only if needed, when an advertisement would be displayed for the first time. You can change your consent settings any time on the Consent page in the drawer menu.<br/>
<br/>
<b>AdMob</b><br/>
AdMob is an advertising service provided by AdMob Google Inc. Please read this overview of how they use information from sites or apps that use their services: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a> <br/>Personal Data collected: Unique device identifiers for advertising. For example, Google Advertiser ID . <br/>Place of processing: United States<br/>
<br/>
<b>Analytics</b>
In the app we use analytics (usage and error data) in order to understand how users engage with our app and how to improve them and fix potential errors. When you use the app your device automatically sends certain information to our analytics partner Google Firebase. The information gathered includes, for example, the device type, the session length, and interactions with various user interface elements (buttons) in the app. The analytics data collected is anonymous and is not personal data. At first startup of an app we generate a random unique identifier which does not contain any personal information, and cannot be used to uncover any such information.<br/>Because no personal data is sent to the analytics partner, no consent is required. Your identity cannot be traced back from the data that is sent.<br/>
